# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction


### Introduction

Parkinson disease(PD), the second most common neurological disorder that causes significant disability, reduces the quality of life and has no cure. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. 

The machine learning model can be implemented to significantly improve diagnosis method of Parkinson disease .In this study it indicates that the ensemble technique SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm achieved the high test accuracy rate compared to other classification algorithm .
